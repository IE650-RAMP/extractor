150 h per semester
Workload You are expected to be familiar with the use of Petri nets and
Prerequisites BPMN for process modeling and being able to do basic
programming in Python. IS 515 or having experience with
process mining are NOT prerequisites.
Process mining is an emerging branch of data science that
aims at deriving qualitative and quantitative insights on the
execution of organizational processes, based on the analysis
of recorded event sequences.
The course features lectures and exercises that focus on the
formal foundations, algorithms, and techniques of process
mining. Specifically, this course covers aspects such as:
• Process discovery, which aims to derive a process model
from recorded events
• Conformance checking, which aims to identify deviations
between event data and process models
• Process enhancement, which aims to augment process
models with information on the temporal, organizational,
Aim of module
and data perspectives of a process
• Predictive monitoring, which aims to make predictions
about ongoing process instances
• Techniques to preprocess, abstract, cluster event data for
improved analyses
For the above subjects, the course will cover fundamental
algorithms as well as advanced, state-of-the-art techniques.
During the exercises that follow each lecture, you will
practice through pen-and-paper exercises, as well as
implementation and evaluation using open-source process
mining tools and libraries.
• The lectures and exercises are complemented by a
practical assignment in which students will work in
55groups on a project that involves implementation and/or
evaluation of a process mining technique.
Knowledge:
• After completing the course, students will be familiar
with fundamental and state-of-the-art techniques for the
data-driven analysis of business processes, i.e., process
mining.
