Prerequisites
programming languages: Java/Python/C#/C++).
Students are expected to successfully complete a team project in
teams of 2-4 members. The projects will focus on a variety of IR
problems and implementation of IR models theoretically covered in
the course Information Retrieval and Web Search (IE 663). It is thus
Aim of module highly recommended to attend this course together with the
course IE 663. Project deliverables include both software (i.e., code
and documentation) and a short report explaining the work
performed and its evaluation. The students are expected to clearly
and coherently present the project results.
Expertise:
Students will be able to solve real-world retrieval and search
problems: they will be able to analyze different potential solutions
to a given problem, identify their advantages and shortcomings,
and decide for the best solution. (MK1, MF1)
Methodological competence:
Students will obtain skills needed to implement one or more
Learning outcomes and information retrieval models and test their usefulness on real-
qualification goals world problems. Successful participants will be able to fully
understand state-of-the-art methods for Information Retrieval and
Web search, through hands-on experience of implementing those
models. Students will also develop and/or improve their project
organization skills (activity planning, work breakdown, time
planning, etc.) (MK2, MF3, MF4, MKO3)
Personal competence:
• Presentation skills
65• Team work skills

Fundamental notions of linear algebra and probability theory.
Prerequisites Successful completion of “Text Analytics” (IE661), “Machine
Learning” (IE675b) or “Deep Learning” (IE678).
This module builds upon the introduction to Natural
Language Processing (NLP) from “Text Analytics” (IE661) and
introduces students to cutting-edge problems, techniques,
and state-of-the-art methods in NLP. The course will focus on
neural models of meaning in context and present a variety of
Aim of module “Deep Learning” architectures for different applications in
human language technology (e.g., summarization, dialogue
systems and machine translation). Moreover, we will cover
open research areas, such as the explainability and
interpretability of NLP models and methods to quantify the
degree of bias they exhibit.
Expertise:
Students will acquire knowledge of state-of-the-art principles
and methods of Natural Language Processing, specifically
focusing on applying statistical methods to human language
technologies.
