A type system is a syntactic method for enforcing levels of ab-
straction in programs. The study of type systems—and of pro-
gramming languages from a type-theoretic perspective—has im-
portant applications in software engineering, language design,
high-performance compilers, and security. In this lecture, we will
discuss the following topics:
Aim of module • Lambda calculus
• Static and dynamic semantics of programming languages
• Functional programming
• Curry-Howard correspondence
• Computational logic
• Proof assistants
• Typed intermediate languages
Expertise:
• Get acquainted with the aims of the module
(MK1, MK2, MF1, MF3)
Methodological competence:
• Students will get familiar with the jargon used in scientific
Learning outcomes and publications about programming languages
qualification goals (MF1, MF2, MF3)
Personal competence:
• Learn how to read scientific publications about program-
ming languages
• Teamwork skills

There are no formal prerequisites but knowledge in cryptography
Prerequisites and/or IT-security is recommended, e.g., by attending the lec-
tures “Kryptographie I” or “Selected Topics in IT-Security”
Blockchains promise secure and reliable data storage and consen-
sus in a trustless environment. In the light of their growing popu-
larity, Blockchain security becomes increasingly important. The
course will equip students with a solid understanding of block-

chains, their design principles, underlying technologies and cryp-
tographic primitives. Bitcoin, Monero and Ethereum will be dis-
cussed in greater detail and a substantial part of the course will
be devoted to security issues and possible attacks.
Expertise:
Students will acquire profound knowledge of Blockchain technol-
ogy as well as the skills to critically examine the security of Block-
chain-based systems.
(MK1, MK2)
Methodological competence:
Successful participants will be able to understand and evaluate
the different ways in which different Blockchain systems try to
Learning outcomes and achieve security. They will also be able to identify where, why and
qualification goals how these security measures are broken for both, current and
new systems.
(MKO3)
Personal competence:
The analytic, concentrated, and precise thinking of the students is
trained. As multiple different but related Blockchains are dis-
cussed, their abstraction capacity is further developed and the
transfer of the learned concepts to related questions is trained.

Given the vastness and richness of the Web, users need high-per-
forming, scalable and efficient methods to access its wealth of in-
formation and satisfy their information needs. As such, being able
to search and effectively retrieve relevant pieces of information
from large text collections is a crucial task for the majority (if prac-
tically not all) of Web applications. In this course, we will explore a
variety of basic and advanced techniques for text-based infor-
mation retrieval and Web search. Covered topics will include:
Aim of module • Efficient text indexing;
• Boolean and vector space retrieval models;
• Probabilistic and semantic ad-hoc retrieval;
• Evaluation of retrieval systems;
• Text classification and clustering;
• Web search, crawling and link-based algorithms.
This course provides theoretical information retrieval foundations.
As such is highly to be attended together with the course Infor-
mation Retrieval Project (IE 691).
Expertise:
Students will acquire knowledge of fundamental techniques of In-
formation Retrieval and Web Search, including standard retrieval

tion and clustering, as well as web search topics such as crawling
and link-based algorithms.

34Methodological competence:
Successful participants will be able to understand state-of-the-art
methods for Information Retrieval and Web search, as well as be-
ing able to select, apply and evaluate the most appropriate tech-
niques for a variety of different search scenarios.

Data integration is one of the key challenges in most IT projects
and it is estimated that data scientists spend about 80% of their
time on data integration and data preparation. Within the enter-
prise context, data integration problems arise whenever data from
separate sources needs to be combined as the basis for new appli-
cations or data analysis projects. Within the context of the Web,
data integration techniques form the foundation for taking ad-
vantage of the ever-growing number of publicly-accessible data
sources. The course will cover the following topics:
1. Heterogeneity and Distributedness
Aim of module
2. The Data Integration Process
3. Structured Data on the Web
4. Data Exchange Formats
5. Schema Mapping and Data Translation
6. Identity Resolution
7. Data Quality Assessment
8. Data Fusion
It is highly recommended to attend the course web data integra-
tion project in the same semester as this course as the schedules of
both courses are aligned to each other.
Expertise:
Students will be able to identify opportunities for employing Web
data in business applications and will learn to select and apply ap-
propriate techniques for integrating and cleansing Web data.
Learning outcomes and (MK1, MF1)
qualification goals Methodological competence:
• Participants will acquire knowledge of the data integration pro-
cess as well as the techniques that are used in each phase of
the process.
