The lecture deals with the design and the analysis of algorithms
for various practically relevant computational problems and with
methods for analyzing the complexity of certain problems. In par-
ticular, we will learn methods of formalizing discrete optimization
problems and designing algorithms for them on the basis of ana-
lyzing the structure of these problems.
Moreover, we will learn techniques for proving the correctness
and estimating the running time of these algorithms. In the sec-
ond part of the lecture, we will deal with the theory of NP-com-

• matching problems
• satisfiability problems
• discret linear optimization problems

have attended this lecture. The lecture “Cryptography II” can
be studied without any prior knowledge on cryptography – all
necessary basics are shortly recapitulated.
The goal of this lecture is to present and discuss important
scientific concepts from modern cryptography. This includes:
• Security Definitions: How can the security of crypto-
graphic schemes formally defined?
• Proofs of Security: How can the security of cryptographic
Aim of module
schemes be proven (based on precise assumptions)?
• Cryptanalysis: What are the established techniques to an-
alyze cryptographic mechanisms?
• Elliptic Curves
• Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Expertise:
With the help of current techniques and theories of modern
cryptography, the students can assess the security of crypto-
graphic processes and assess security statements accord-
ingly. Furthermore, they can identify security goals and use
appropriate techniques that could not be dealt with in “CS
404 Cryptography I”.
(MK2)
Methodological competence:
Learning outcomes and The students can select and use suitable methods for the se-
qualification goals curity analysis of cryptographic processes. This includes, for
example, the choice of the appropriate security model, proof
of security based on clearly specified assumptions and the
analysis of given procedures. In particular, the students can
understand and assess the security arguments for existing
procedures and to transfer them to new ones. Furthermore,
they can use techniques and protocols to achieve security
goals that were not yet possible with the methods discussed
in “CS 404 Cryptography I”.
(MK1)
26Personal competence:
The analytic, concentrated, and precise thinking of the students is
trained. By the independent treatment of applications, e.g. in the
course of the exercises, their abstraction capacity is further devel-
oped and the transfer of the learned material to related questions
is trained.

Given the vastness and richness of the Web, users need high-per-
forming, scalable and efficient methods to access its wealth of in-
formation and satisfy their information needs. As such, being able
to search and effectively retrieve relevant pieces of information
from large text collections is a crucial task for the majority (if prac-
tically not all) of Web applications. In this course, we will explore a
variety of basic and advanced techniques for text-based infor-
mation retrieval and Web search. Covered topics will include:
Aim of module • Efficient text indexing;
• Boolean and vector space retrieval models;
• Probabilistic and semantic ad-hoc retrieval;
• Evaluation of retrieval systems;
• Text classification and clustering;
• Web search, crawling and link-based algorithms.
This course provides theoretical information retrieval foundations.
As such is highly to be attended together with the course Infor-
mation Retrieval Project (IE 691).

Data integration is one of the key challenges in most IT projects
and it is estimated that data scientists spend about 80% of their
time on data integration and data preparation. Within the enter-
prise context, data integration problems arise whenever data from
separate sources needs to be combined as the basis for new appli-
cations or data analysis projects. Within the context of the Web,
data integration techniques form the foundation for taking ad-
vantage of the ever-growing number of publicly-accessible data
sources. The course will cover the following topics:
1. Heterogeneity and Distributedness
Aim of module
2. The Data Integration Process
3. Structured Data on the Web
4. Data Exchange Formats
5. Schema Mapping and Data Translation
6. Identity Resolution
