Form of Module Lecture
Type of Module Specialization course
Level Master
ECTS 6
150 h per semester
Workload You are expected to be familiar with the use of Petri nets and
Prerequisites BPMN for process modeling, and being able to do basic program-
ming in Python. IS 515 or having experience with process mining
are NOT prerequisites.
Process mining is an emerging branch of data science that aims at
deriving qualitative and quantitative insights on the execution of
organizational processes, based on the analysis of recorded event
sequences.
The course features lectures and exercises that focus on the formal
foundations, algorithms, and techniques of process mining. Specifi-
cally, this course covers aspects such as:
• Process discovery, which aims to derive a process model from
recorded events
• Conformance checking, which aims to identify deviations be-
tween event data and process models
• Process enhancement, which aims to augment process models
with information on the temporal, organizational, and data per-
Aim of module spectives of a process
• Predictive monitoring, which aims to make predictions about
ongoing process instances
• Techniques to preprocess, abstract, cluster event data for im-
proved analyses
For the above subjects, the course will cover fundamental algo-
rithms as well as advanced, state-of-the-art techniques.
During the exercises that follow each lecture, you will practice
through pen-and-paper exercises, as well as implementation and
evaluation using open source process mining tools and libraries.
• The lectures and exercises are complemented by a practical as-
signment in which students will work in groups on a project
that involves implementation and/or evaluation of a process
mining technique.
63Knowledge:
• After completing the course, students will be familiar with fun-
damental and state-of-the-art techniques for the data-driven
analysis of business processes, i.e., process mining.
