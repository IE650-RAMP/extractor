Hours per semester present: 28 (2 SWS)

As “big data” and “algorithms” affect our daily communication,
new research questions arise at the intersection between societies
and technologies. Many of these questions are of great social rele-
vance and are therefore prominently discussed both by research-
ers and in the media. One outstanding, recent example from the
field of media psychology is a rising interest in the association of
(social) media use and mental health. Another example, from the
realm of political communication, is the ongoing debate about the
role of new communication technologies during political campaigns
Aim of module
(e.g., to spread disinformation). Both questions revolve around the
process of communication. Sound research in this area thus re-
quires both a solid foundation from communication theory as well
as expertise in handling new and “big” data. To close this gap, the
growing discipline of Computational Communication Science (CCS)
takes on a combinatory perspective between social and computer
science. The present course will provide an overview about the cur-
rent state of CCS and intends to motivate students to approach
pressing social questions from a different perspective.
Expertise:
After the course the students are aware of the typical research top-
ics and questions in automated media content analyses and the dif-
Learning outcomes and ferent methodological approaches for tackling them; they know
qualification goals the different methods’ potentials, limitations, and typical fields of
application; they are able to develop their own specific research
questions and can make an informed decision about which method
to apply for answering it (MK3).
93Methodological competence:
Students are able to independently develop a research question
and design in the area of automated media content analysis and
can conduct a respective analysis using one of the different meth-
odological approaches introduced in the exercise; they are able to
document the results of their analyses in a research report and re-
flect upon their findings’ limitations with regards to reliability and
validity.
(MF1, MF2, MF3, MF4, MF5)
Personal competence:
The course supports students to develop problem-solving compe-
tences with regards to research-design oriented questions. By solv-
ing exercises independently, the transfer of the learned material to
related questions is promoted and self-confidence with regards to
research-oriented tasks is gathered (MKO3).
