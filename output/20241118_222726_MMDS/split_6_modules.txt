Workload You are expected to be familiar with the use of Petri nets and
Prerequisites BPMN for process modeling, and being able to do basic program-
ming in Python. IS 515 or having experience with process mining
are NOT prerequisites.
Process mining is an emerging branch of data science that aims at
deriving qualitative and quantitative insights on the execution of
organizational processes, based on the analysis of recorded event
sequences.
The course features lectures and exercises that focus on the formal
foundations, algorithms, and techniques of process mining. Specifi-
cally, this course covers aspects such as:
• Process discovery, which aims to derive a process model from
recorded events
• Conformance checking, which aims to identify deviations be-
tween event data and process models
• Process enhancement, which aims to augment process models
with information on the temporal, organizational, and data per-
Aim of module spectives of a process
• Predictive monitoring, which aims to make predictions about
ongoing process instances
• Techniques to preprocess, abstract, cluster event data for im-
proved analyses
For the above subjects, the course will cover fundamental algo-
rithms as well as advanced, state-of-the-art techniques.
During the exercises that follow each lecture, you will practice
through pen-and-paper exercises, as well as implementation and
evaluation using open source process mining tools and libraries.
• The lectures and exercises are complemented by a practical as-
signment in which students will work in groups on a project
that involves implementation and/or evaluation of a process
mining technique.
63Knowledge:
• After completing the course, students will be familiar with fun-
damental and state-of-the-art techniques for the data-driven

Prerequisites
tical inference is required. Knowledge in linear algebra and
calculus is useful.
The course aims to introduce students to advanced causal in-
ference and machine learning methods, discussing models in
detail. It first deals with causal inference topics, for instance,
synthetic control and its extensions, causal inference in panel
and difference-in-difference models. The course also covers
Aim of module estimating mediation effects, controlled direct effects, and
gives an introduction to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The
second part of the course then discusses a theory of causal
estimation and the role of machine learning in estimating
these effects. Advanced and popular techniques of machine
learning are introduced.
Expertise:
Students are aware of how machine learning can help answer
causal questions; they can analyze (large) data sets using
popular techniques of machine learning.
Learning outcomes and (MK1)
qualification goals Methodological competence:
Students are able to translate their research question(s) into
a causal framework; they can apply different techniques of
machine learning.
(MK1, MK3)
74Personal competence:
The course supports students to develop competences with
regard to choosing the appropriate statistical method(s) to
answer respective research questions.
