78DS 203 Responsible AI: Conceptual Foundations, Methods and Applications
Lecture with Essay
Form of module
Specialization Course
Type of module
Level Master
ECTS 6
Hours per semester in presence: 28 (2 SWS)
Workload
Self-study: 56 h lectures; 20 h essay / preparation oral exam
Basic knowledge about AI systems (knowledge-based systems, machine
Prerequisites
learning, deep neural networks)
Conceptual foundations:
- understanding of important concepts in human-AI interaction and AI
ethics (such as trust, autonomy, responsibility)
Methods:
- e.g., narrative interviews, group discussions, design research methods
(prototyping, design thinking, techno-mimesis), (digital) ethnography,
Aim of module
participatory action research
Applications:
- AI in medicine and healthcare
- Social robotics
- Generative AI
- other use cases / real-world AI applications
Expertise: Students gain insights and understanding of important
concepts in human-AI interaction and AI ethics. They learn modes of
transdisciplinary thinking and theorizing. Along sector-specific use cases
they learn about ethical, legal and social aspects and challenges of real-
world AI application, e.g. for healthcare.
Learning outcomes and
qualification goals Methodological competence: Students learn elements of mixed-
methods study design for human-AI interaction research
Personal competence: Students learn to critically assess conceptual,
ethical, legal and social aspects of human-AI interaction. They gain skills
in transdisciplinary research and theory-building and learn to transfer
these insights to real-world human-AI interaction scenarios.
