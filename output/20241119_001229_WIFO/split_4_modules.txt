Prerequisites
to have attended this lecture. The lecture “Cryptography II”
can be studied without any prior knowledge on cryptography
– all necessary basics are shortly recapitulated.
The goal of this lecture is to present and discuss important
scientific concepts from modern cryptography. This includes:
• Security Definitions: How can the security of
cryptographic schemes formally defined?
• Proofs of Security: How can the security of cryptographic
Aim of module
schemes be proven (based on precise assumptions)?
• Cryptanalysis: What are the established techniques to
analyze cryptographic mechanisms?
• Elliptic Curves
• Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Expertise:
With the help of current techniques and theories of modern
cryptography, the students can assess the security of
cryptographic processes and assess security statements
accordingly. Furthermore, they can identify security goals
and use appropriate techniques that could not be dealt with
in “CS 404 Cryptography I”.

Methodological competence:
Learning outcomes and The students can select and use suitable methods for the
qualification goals security analysis of cryptographic processes. This includes, for
example, the choice of the appropriate security model, proof
of security based on clearly specified assumptions and the
analysis of given procedures. In particular, the students can
understand and assess the security arguments for existing
procedures and to transfer them to new ones. Furthermore,
they can use techniques and protocols to achieve security
goals that were not yet possible with the methods discussed
in “CS 404 Cryptography I”.
(MK1)
31Personal competence:
The analytic, concentrated, and precise thinking of the students is
trained. By the independent treatment of applications, e.g. in the
course of the exercises, their abstraction capacity is further
developed and the transfer of the learned material to related
questions is trained.

Given the vastness and richness of the Web, users need high-
performing, scalable and efficient methods to access its wealth of
information and satisfy their information needs. As such, being
able to search and effectively retrieve relevant pieces of

majority (if practically not all) of Web applications. In this course,
we will explore a variety of basic and advanced techniques for text-
based information retrieval and Web search. Covered topics will
include:
Aim of module
• Efficient text indexing;
• Boolean and vector space retrieval models;
• Probabilistic and semantic ad-hoc retrieval;
• Evaluation of retrieval systems;
• Text classification and clustering;
• Web search, crawling and link-based algorithms.
This course provides theoretical information retrieval foundations.
As such is highly to be attended together with the course
Information Retrieval Project (IE 691).

Data integration is one of the key challenges in most IT
projects and it is estimated that data scientists spend about
80% of their time on data integration and data preparation.
Within the enterprise context, data integration problems
arise whenever data from separate sources needs to be
combined as the basis for new applications or data analysis
projects. Within the context of the Web, data integration
techniques form the foundation for taking advantage of the
ever-growing number of publicly-accessible data sources. The
course will cover the following topics:
Aim of module 1. Heterogeneity and Distributedness
2. The Data Integration Process
3. Structured Data on the Web
4. Data Exchange Formats
5. Schema Mapping and Data Translation
6. Identity Resolution
7. Data Quality Assessment
8. Data Fusion
It is highly recommended to attend the course web data
integration project in the same semester as this course as the
schedules of both courses are aligned to each other.
