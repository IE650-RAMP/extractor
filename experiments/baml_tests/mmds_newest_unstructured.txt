scientific concepts from modern cryptography. This includes:
• Security Definitions: How can the security of crypto-
graphic schemes formally defined?
• Proofs of Security: How can the security of cryptographic

• Cryptanalysis: What are the established techniques to an-
alyze cryptographic mechanisms?
• Elliptic Curves
• Zero-Knowledge Proofs
Expertise:
With the help of current techniques and theories of modern
cryptography, the students can assess the security of crypto-
graphic processes and assess security statements accord-
ingly. Furthermore, they can identify security goals and use
appropriate techniques that could not be dealt with in “CS
404 Cryptography I”.

example, the choice of the appropriate security model, proof
of security based on clearly specified assumptions and the
analysis of given procedures. In particular, the students can
understand and assess the security arguments for existing
procedures and to transfer them to new ones. Furthermore,
they can use techniques and protocols to achieve security
goals that were not yet possible with the methods discussed
in “CS 404 Cryptography I”.

Data integration is one of the key challenges in most IT projects
and it is estimated that data scientists spend about 80% of their
time on data integration and data preparation. Within the enter-
prise context, data integration problems arise whenever data from
separate sources needs to be combined as the basis for new appli-
cations or data analysis projects. Within the context of the Web,
data integration techniques form the foundation for taking ad-
vantage of the ever-growing number of publicly-accessible data
sources. The course will cover the following topics:
1. Heterogeneity and Distributedness
Aim of module
2. The Data Integration Process
3. Structured Data on the Web
4. Data Exchange Formats
5. Schema Mapping and Data Translation
6. Identity Resolution
7. Data Quality Assessment
8. Data Fusion

In a first section the course will acquaint the students with the ori-

more, it will contrast the European privacy foundations with the
U.S. approach. At the core of this course stands the new European
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its applicability to
specific cases and basic principles. Moreover, the course will cover
current challenges to the existing privacy paradigms by big data
and big data analytics.
In a second section the course will cover ethical aspects of the use

of personal and non-personal data. Data potentially allows to iden-
tify and target individuals and offer individualized products to
them. However, sometimes this kind of individualization might be
legal but the question arises whether it is also desirable from an
ethical and societal point of view? The course will use selected ex-
amples (e.g. first-degree price discrimination) in order to illustrate
the ambivalence of legality, legitimacy, and ethics. In this context,
the use of artificial intelligence and its impact on privacy will be ad-
dressed.
Students will…

As “big data” and “algorithms” affect our daily communication,
new research questions arise at the intersection between societies
and technologies. Many of these questions are of great social rele-
vance and are therefore prominently discussed both by research-
ers and in the media. One outstanding, recent example from the
field of media psychology is a rising interest in the association of
(social) media use and mental health. Another example, from the
realm of political communication, is the ongoing debate about the
role of new communication technologies during political campaigns
Aim of module
(e.g., to spread disinformation). Both questions revolve around the
process of communication. Sound research in this area thus re-
quires both a solid foundation from communication theory as well
as expertise in handling new and “big” data. To close this gap, the
growing discipline of Computational Communication Science (CCS)
takes on a combinatory perspective between social and computer
science. The present course will provide an overview about the cur-
rent state of CCS and intends to motivate students to approach
pressing social questions from a different perspective.
Expertise:
After the course the students are aware of the typical research top-
ics and questions in automated media content analyses and the dif-
Learning outcomes and ferent methodological approaches for tackling them; they know
qualification goals the different methods’ potentials, limitations, and typical fields of
application; they are able to develop their own specific research
questions and can make an informed decision about which method
to apply for answering it (MK3).
93Methodological competence:
Students are able to independently develop a research question
and design in the area of automated media content analysis and
can conduct a respective analysis using one of the different meth-
odological approaches introduced in the exercise; they are able to
document the results of their analyses in a research report and re-
flect upon their findings’ limitations with regards to reliability and
validity.
(MF1, MF2, MF3, MF4, MF5)
Personal competence:
The course supports students to develop problem-solving compe-
tences with regards to research-design oriented questions. By solv-
ing exercises independently, the transfer of the learned material to
related questions is promoted and self-confidence with regards to
research-oriented tasks is gathered (MKO3).

139Abbreviations
Explanation of abbreviations
This degree program provides students with a solid theoretical foundation as well as practi-
cal skills for data management, data analytics methods, responsible data science and data
science applications. The courses are divided in five groups - Data Science Fundamentals,
Data Management, Data Analytics Methods, Responsible Data Science, and Data Science Ap-
plications. After studying the fundamentals of Data Sciences, students will then learn how to
manage, analyse, and responsibly handle data. Furthermore, they will learn about the differ-
ent applications of data science in computer science, social sciences, or business and eco-
nomics. In addition to the regular lecture courses, students participate in a one or two se-
mester team project or individual project.
Knowledge
During their studies -
(MK1) all students develop a deep understanding of the relevant concepts, methods
and problem solving strategies used in different application domains.
(MK2) technology-oriented students learn the concepts, algorithms and strategies
used to solve concrete, practical application-oriented problems in informatics.
(MK3) social sciences-oriented students develop a deep understanding of how to set
up, analyse and interpret advanced empirical research questions.
As part of this education, students become familiar with a wide range of models, modelling
languages, methods, and tools. Regardless of their specialization, students also learn how to
collect, structure, manipulate, prepare, interpret, communicate, and use data, information
and knowledge.
140Capabilities
After completing their studies, students have the ability to –
(MF1) apply a wide range of abstraction and analysis techniques.
(MF2) understand, interpret, describe and present relevant scientific publications.
(MF3) exploit the latest scientific results.
(MF4) independently tackle problems in data management and analytics and de-
scribe their results in a structured, written form.
(MF5) continue their studies at the PhD level, if their results are of sufficient quality.
Competencies
After completing their studies, students have the competences needed to –
(MKO1) apply their knowledge and capabilities to solve specific problems in a team
context.
(MKO2) use their interdisciplinary education to mediate between technical and non-
technical individuals.
(MKO3) evaluate the latest changes in programming languages, systems, models and,
wherever possible, exploit them to develop better solutions to data-science
related problems.
